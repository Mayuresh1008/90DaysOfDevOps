# ðŸ“˜ DevOps Overview

## ðŸ”§ What is DevOps:

**DevOps** is a set of practices that bridges the gap between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to automate and integrate the processes between development and operations teams so they can build, test, and release software faster and more reliably.

Key principles of DevOps include:
- Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- Automation of repetitive tasks
- Monitoring and performance tracking
- Collaboration across teams
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
